# Introduction to SchemaLib

## What is SchemaLib?

SchemaLib is a schema language for defining API Services, Data structures, Apps and more.
It's also a searchable library / repository of various schemas contributed by the community.

**Main SchemaLib benefits :**    

### Standardized Communication Between Clients & API Services.

Schema language provides constructs for defining API service endpoints and
what types of data is passed in and returned by them. This establishes strong
contracts between Clients and Services which simplifies validation and reduces bugs.

### Simple easy to use and read schema language.

SchemaLib uses a custom syntax to describe schema with as little elements as possible.
This makes writing schemas more inviting and easier to understand.

### Simplify App/Service Boilerplate Creation.   

Since you can define schema of the whole app, you are able to create boilerplate structure of a
full application. SchemaLib plans to support full spectrum of generators for various programming languages.

### Share and Reuse common schema via searchable library/registry   

One of the primary goal of SchemaLib is to improve reusability and to allow community
to establish common communication structures between services which can be written once and reused by everyone.
You can search all the public schema via website, API or SchemaLib CLI.
